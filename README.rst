Introduction
============


This repository contains the tools used to:

* combine AIBS annotation files to reinstate missing brain regions
* assign direction vectors or orientations to voxels in a selected brain region
* compute distances of voxels to region boundaries (placement hints)
* compute densities of cells in each voxel of a brain region
* compute neuron 3D positions in a selected brain region
